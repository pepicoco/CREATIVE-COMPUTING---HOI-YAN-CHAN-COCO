Technology has changed our lives in many ways, like development in economics, or helps us to gain knowledge on machines or anything, likewise technology comforts our life.
# What I've learned during class

During class as a group we have learned how to build up an arduino remote
To be honest I don't really have a big interest in creative computing at first but after doing some research I kinda change my point of view I guess(?) So on I did further research on Holographic which I really found interested in.

# Holographic
Holography is a technique that enables a wavefront to be recorded and later re-constructed. Holography is best known as a method of generating three-dimensional images, but it also has a wide range of other applications. In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any type of wave. 
A hologram is made by superimposing a second wavefront (normally called the reference beam) on the wavefront of interest, thereby generating an interference pattern which is recorded on a physical medium. When only the second wavefront illuminates the interference pattern, it is diffracted to recreate the original wavefront. Holograms can also be computer-generated by modelling the two wavefronts and adding them together digitally. The resulting digital image is then printed onto a suitable mask or film and illuminated by a suitable source to reconstruct the wavefront of interest.

Before the covid pandemic Korean idol usually will have lots of offline events, such as fansign, radio show, concert etc...
But after the pandemic break out all the offline event had totally cancelled or postponed especially concert. All the world tour had cancelled which means fans can't meet their idol in person, so there's come up with a lot of online events which all the global fans can participate. Holographic Concert is also a way to let fans "meet their idol"
# Holographic Concert
Fans are flocking to various theaters around Seoul and other major cities in Asia to get a glimpse of their favorite idols dominating the stage as full, life-sized holograms. The trend of holographic is continuing to thrive as more people are able to attend the shows.
Holograms and virtual reality technologies are being increasingly deployed as an alternative to live performances as Seoul seeks to entertain the burgeoning group of K-pop fans visiting the home country of their idols. Although it may sound creepy to some, hologram concerts and virtual spaces where fans can digitally interact with their idols
